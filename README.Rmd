## The Story Goes..

I used to live in Zhengzhou city. The year is 2016, My uni is in far western end Zhengzhou
Two hours ride on subways (or UK they call it "tube") from "ErQi Square" which is the vibrant town center of Zhengzhou City.

I used to ride the tube every now and then. 
Because the underground rail way system was new development, comfortable. It is 
one of few subways system in China that actually have AC and 4G signals. 
Zhengzhou is considering one of four "hottest cities" in mainland 
China. During hot boiling summer, the subway is extra-ordinarily chill. For us 
students who don't have AC at dorm, we just wish we could sleep on the railway. 

I left the city for UK in 2018. Three years after I left, the city was flooded. 
The very tube line I used to ride is compromised. Underground tubes turns into 
underground river. People who ride tube on the day and couldn't get out 
in time drowned or suffocated. These are people who ride the tube every day. 


While Zhengzhou is the hottest city, it is also the most populated, capital of
Henan, the province with largest proportion of poverty. Having the underground 
tube built was one of the proudest things of Zhengzhou people. It turns out the
tube system did not proofed against extreme precipitation.

This analysis reveals some obvious participation pattern in Zhengzhou in the past.
